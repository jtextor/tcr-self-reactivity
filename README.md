# TCR example

*Summary of the study*

This repository contains the source code of the model and scripts to train the model and to perform inference. A subset of the sequences used to train the model can be found maybe upload to Zenodo? 

## System requirments
The model is implemented in Python 3.6 and Tensorflow 2.5.0. 

## Using the model
### Training

### Inferencing on new sequences
